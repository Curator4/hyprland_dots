1. Display Manager (DM)

    What it is: A graphical login screen that allows you to choose sessions and log in.
    Examples: SDDM, LightDM, GDM, or Ly (a TUI display manager).
    Hyprland-specific note: Hyprland can be launched without a DM by starting it directly from a TTY, often through .bash_profile, .zprofile, or systemd service.

3. Status Bar / Panel

    What it is: Displays system information like time, workspaces, CPU/memory usage, and battery life.
    Examples:
        Waybar (popular for Wayland).
        eww (highly customizable, lightweight widgets).
    Hyprland-specific note: Waybar integrates seamlessly and supports Hyprland modules.

4. Launcher

    What it is: A tool to search and launch applications.
    Examples:
        rofi (popular for X11, can work with Wayland).
        wofi (designed for Wayland).
    Why it's useful: Fast app launching without navigating menus.

5. Notification Daemon - can always customize this -

    What it is: Displays system and application notifications.
    Examples:
        mako (minimal, Wayland-compatible).
        dunst (can work but not Wayland-native).
    Why it matters: Ensures you see alerts like updates, messages, or battery warnings.

6. File Manager

    What it is: Manages files and directories in a graphical interface.
    Examples:
        Thunar, Nautilus, Dolphin (general-purpose file managers).
        nnn, lf (terminal-based, minimalist options).
    Why it's useful: Essential for navigating and managing files unless you’re comfortable with terminal commands like ls and mv.

7. Audio Management

    What it is: Tools to control volume, devices, and audio streams.
    Examples:
        PipeWire with WirePlumber or PulseAudio.
        Frontends: pavucontrol, wpctl.
    Why it's important: To manage sound devices and streams effectively.

8. Clipboard Manager

    What it is: Manages copied text and images for reuse.
    Examples:
        wl-clipboard (Wayland-compatible).
        clipman (minimal clipboard manager).
    Why it helps: Stores clipboard history and allows easy retrieval.

9. Session Management Tools

    What it is: Manages power actions like locking, suspending, or shutting down.
    Examples:
        swaylock (for screen locking, Wayland-compatible).
        grim + slurp (for screenshots).
        wlogout (for logout/shutdown menus).
    Why you need them: Provides essential controls for managing your session.

10. Wallpaper Manager

    What it is: Sets and manages wallpapers.
    Examples:
        swaybg (Wayland-native).
        hsetroot (minimalist).
        azote (GUI for wallpapers).
    Why it's cool: Adds personality to your desktop.

11. Keybinding & Hotkey Tools

    What it is: While most WMs (including Hyprland) handle hotkeys natively, external tools can extend functionality.
    Examples:
        sxhkd (for advanced custom bindings, though less needed with Hyprland).
    Why it matters: Allows customization of shortcuts and commands.

12. Resource Monitoring

    What it is: Monitors system resources like CPU, RAM, and temperatures.
    Examples:
        CLI tools: htop, btop.
        GUI: conky, Waybar modules.
    Why it's useful: Keeps track of system performance.

13. Terminal Emulator

    What it is: The interface for shell commands.
    Examples:
        Kitty (what you’re using).
        Alacritty (Wayland-friendly).
    Why it’s essential: Core part of any Linux workflow.
